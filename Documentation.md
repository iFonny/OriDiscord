## Making a plugin
By making a plugin to **AlexFlipnote/Discord_Theme**, you agree that your file will be used and *owner* by **Discord_Theme**, you can by any will, add credits to your work. All plugins has to be in **.css** format, meaning you're not allowed to use anything else (We might support more like **SCSS** and **LESS**)

Remember that everything you make **must** be documented in [Plugins.md](https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/Discord_Theme/blob/master/Plugins.md) to provide easier access for users who wish to use either our or your creation.

## Colour usage
In our theme, we have a global variable called :root, it can be found similar to this
```css
:root {
  /*--<var>: <value>*/
  --accent: mediumpurple;
  --dark-primary: #212121;
  --dark-secondary: #303030;
}
```
**Usage:**
```css
#user-profile-modal .header {
  background-color: var(--dark-primary);
  background-image: none;
}
```
Having global variables makes colours easier to change, rather than changing one by one.
This might not be supportive when it comes to browsers **( Tested & works on: Chrome, Firefox )**
